# 🧠 Fundamentals of Programming with C++

Welcome to My **C++** programming fundamentals project!  
This repository contains Fundamentals of Programming  With C++ that demonstrate core programming concepts, built as part of my learning journey.

---

## 📌 Project Goals 

- Apply fundamental programming concepts using C++
- Practice writing clean, well-structured, and readable code
- Build a strong foundation for more advanced software development

---

## 🛠️ What You'll Find

The repository includes C++ programs that cover:

- ✅ Input & Output operations
- ✅ Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- ✅ Functions and basic modular code
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Intro to data structures (arrays, strings)
- ✅ And there's more

## 💡 Simple File

Here's an example from one of the programs:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string answer;
    cout << "Do you love C++? (yes/no): ";
    cin >> answer;

    if (answer == "yes") {
        cout << "Great! C++ is powerful and efficient.\n";
    } else {
        cout << "Maybe it just needs better teaching methods!\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
